Dear members of the Northwestern community,
This morning I became aware that several Israeli and American flags placed on Deering Meadow were defaced overnight. Earlier on Sunday, a woman tore down several signs and banners hanging at the Meadow. Northwestern’s commitment to freedom of expression does not include vandalism. And let me be clear — spraying red paint over Israeli or American flags is vandalism and is unacceptable. The University will investigate these incidents thoroughly, and if individuals from Northwestern can be identified, we will pursue disciplinary action.
Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the University through its new reporting webpage or by contacting University Police.
