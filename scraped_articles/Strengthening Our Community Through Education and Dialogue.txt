Dear members of the Northwestern community,   
Earlier this afternoon, I completed my testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
I discussed four key themes today: the rise of antisemitism — not just at Northwestern but across the country; our guiding principles of community safety and academic freedom; the approach we took with the encampment on Deering Meadow; and, importantly, our plans moving forward. 
The work we have underway — to revise our Student Code of Conduct, a review of our on-campus security capabilities, and a new task force addressing antisemitism — will be a part of the solution. But I also discussed today the most important step that we can take together to strengthen our community — education and dialogue. 
The issues we have confronted this year are larger than any one new policy or module can resolve, though we will implement both in response to our evolving campus climate. As a community we must speak with one another, learn from one another, show grace to one another and find a way to engage with each other in a way that respects the best traditions of Northwestern University. We must hold fast to our values, which include eschewing hate while at the same time protecting free expression and academic freedom. We are a community of outstanding scholars, researchers, students and staff. I have complete confidence that together we can meet this moment.
As we near the end of the academic year, I look forward to celebrating the many achievements and accomplishments of our students, faculty and staff.
