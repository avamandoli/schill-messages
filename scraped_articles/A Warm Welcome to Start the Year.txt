 
Dear members of the Northwestern community,
With today’s start of the Fall Quarter in Evanston, the academic year has now begun across all of our campuses.
To our new students, faculty and staff in Evanston, Chicago and Doha: Welcome to Northwestern!
Ours is an extraordinary community of scholars whose ambitions are deeply grounded in our guiding principles. The work we do each day in our classrooms, laboratories, studios and offices brings us together as a community, pushes us to new discoveries and contributes to making the world a better place to live.
I am eager to see all that we accomplish together over the next year.
