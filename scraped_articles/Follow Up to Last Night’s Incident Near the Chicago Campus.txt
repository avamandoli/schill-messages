Dear members of the Northwestern community,
Last night, starting just before 9 p.m., you received a series of alerts about gunshots that were fired near Wieboldt Hall on Chicago Avenue on the Universityâ€™s Chicago campus.
We want to thank everyone for their quick response in what was a stressful situation.
Northwestern University Police (NUPD) first received a call of shots fired via a campus emergency blue light callbox at 8:55 p.m. and sent the first alert to the community at 8:59 p.m. The alerts continued until police were able to determine there was no longer a threat to campus, and an all-clear was sent at 9:33 p.m.
The University is not aware of any injuries in the incident, which continues to be investigated by the Chicago Police Department. Three people were initially detained by NUPD, but it is not immediately clear if they were involved in the incident. It is believed that none of those involved were affiliated with Northwestern.
We recognize that incidents in which shots are fired are stressful and can create anxiety. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with these safety resources and to have these ready in your smartphone if you ever need them.
