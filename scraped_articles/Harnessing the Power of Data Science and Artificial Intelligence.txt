Dear members of the Northwestern community, 
Data science and artificial intelligence (DS/AI) have entered every sphere of modern life, and the power and impact of these transformative technologies will only continue to grow.  
At Northwestern, DS/AI research has sparked discovery and innovation across areas, from the STEM disciplines to the arts and humanities. Advances in DS/AI are challenging us to rethink how we prepare our students for a dramatically different future. With these limitless possibilities in mind, last fall, Northwestern leadership identified the need to advance foundational research and applications of emerging DS/AI tools as one of our institutional priorities. 
Today, we are excited to share some of the vital steps we are taking to integrate and elevate Northwestern’s many existing strengths in this area.
In addition, we are pleased to bring the entire Northwestern community together for the new Computation and Data Exchange (CoDEx) symposium on Tuesday, April 2, in the Norris University Center on the Evanston campus. Hosted by the Office of the Provost and Northwestern IT, this all-day, campus-wide event will showcase the robust computational and data-enabled research at Northwestern. For more information and to register, visit the CoDEx website. 
We are energized by this important work, which has the potential to shape the future of knowledge, society and global well-being. We also are immensely grateful to the members of our DS/AI Steering Committee for taking on the critical challenge of mapping our path forward.  
This is an auspicious moment for Northwestern, and we look forward to working with our entire community to innovate, imagine and lead.
