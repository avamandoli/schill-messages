Dear members of the Northwestern community, 
Welcome to the 2024-2025 academic year! To help keep you safe this year, here are safety reminders and quick links to resources all in one place that you can save or “favorite” in case you ever need them. 
You will automatically get emergency notices (AlertNU) via email. 
However, in a campus emergency, a text or call is likely the quickest way for the University to reach you.  
To make sure your information is correct and we can reach you by text or phone, please check your contact details in our emergency notification system, Rave, using the instructions here. This should take just a couple of minutes. 
Review our one-page emergency guide for instructions on what to do in a variety of situations. We recommend that you screenshot or save it to your phone, download it on your computer or consider posting it in common spaces. 
Safety is a shared responsibility, and you can make the difference. Be mindful of yourself, look out for those around you and be aware of your surroundings. This reduces opportunities for crime to occur. 
Safety tips: 
Here are just some of the resources available on campus if you need help or you are in a crisis.
If you see something, say something. We have a range of confidential and/or anonymous ways to share a concern. 
The Department of Safety and Security works around the clock to support your safety and well-being. Please visit our website, which details our services to the University community.
