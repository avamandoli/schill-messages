Dear students,
These are incredibly challenging times. We've heard from many students who have been profoundly affected by the escalating violence in Israel and Gaza. Our hearts are heavy with grief for the violence, pain and suffering that so many are enduring.
It is always a sign of strength to seek help and support, and we encourage you to do so now. Please use these Northwestern resources as you care for yourselves and others: 
Please take care of yourselves, your friends, and our community.  We are here for you.
